This extension groups Slack channels by prefix, making it easier to find channels visually.
It supports both hyphens (-) and underscores (_), allowing you to group channels with names like:
• prefix-name
• prefix_name

No information from Slack or other data is transmitted or disclosed to developers or third parties.

The source code is also available, so you can build and install it yourself.
